# Getting Started with PhotoSweeper MVP

Congratulations! All files for the PhotoSweeper MVP have been generated. Here's how to validate and run the project.

## Prerequisites

### Windows (Current Environment)
- âœ… Python 3.8+ installed
- âœ… pip package manager

### macOS (Required for iOS Development)
- macOS 14 (Sonoma) or later
- Xcode 15+
- Apple ID (free account works)

## Step 1: Validate Python Prototype (Windows)

Test the algorithms before iOS compilation:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd Scripts/proto/python
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run on a folder of test images
python proto_sweeper.py --input "C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\TestPhotos" --output results.csv

# Open results.csv in Excel/LibreOffice to review detections
```

**Expected output**:
- CSV with columns: ID, Path, Group, Type, Reason, Size, Recommendation
- Duplicate groups (Hamming â‰¤8)
- Similar groups (Hamming 9-18)
- Useless photos (blur, flat, black, white, finger, burst)

## Step 2: Transfer to macOS

Copy the entire `PhotoSweeper` folder to your Mac:

```bash
# Option 1: USB drive
# Copy folder to USB â†’ Transfer to Mac

# Option 2: Cloud sync (OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud)
# Upload folder â†’ Download on Mac

# Option 3: Git (recommended)
cd C:\Users\hugo\PhotoSweeper
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial PhotoSweeper MVP"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/PhotoSweeper.git
git push -u origin main

# On Mac:
# git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PhotoSweeper.git
```

## Step 3: Build PhotoSweeperCore Package (macOS)

Open Terminal on Mac:

```bash
cd PhotoSweeper/PhotoSweeperCore
swift build
swift test
```

**Expected output**:
```
Build complete! (XX.XXs)
Test Suite 'All tests' passed at 2025-01-19 XX:XX:XX.
     Executed 15 tests, with 0 failures (0 unexpected) in X.XXX seconds
```

If tests fail, check error messages. Common issues:
- Missing dependencies â†’ `swift package resolve`
- Syntax errors â†’ Fix indicated file/line

## Step 4: Create Xcode Project (macOS)

Follow detailed instructions in:
- `PhotoSweeperApp/XCODE_SETUP.md`

**Quick version**:

1. Open Xcode
2. File â†’ New â†’ Project â†’ iOS App
3. Product Name: **PhotoSweeperApp**
4. Interface: **SwiftUI**
5. Save to `PhotoSweeper/PhotoSweeperApp/`
6. Add local package dependency:
   - Project settings â†’ General â†’ Frameworks
   - Add `../PhotoSweeperCore`
7. Copy Swift files from `PhotoSweeperApp/PhotoSweeperApp/` into project
8. Configure capabilities:
   - Photos library access
   - Background modes
   - Push notifications
9. Add StoreKit config (see `StoreKit/STOREKIT_SETUP.md`)

## Step 5: Run on iPhone (macOS)

1. Connect iPhone via USB (iOS 17+)
2. Select device in Xcode toolbar
3. Build & Run (âŒ˜R)
4. On iPhone:
   - Settings â†’ General â†’ VPN & Device Management
   - Trust your developer profile
5. Enable Developer Mode (iOS 16+):
   - Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Developer Mode

**First launch**:
- Grant photo library access
- Complete onboarding
- Start scan â†’ Wait for results
- Review duplicates/similars/useless photos
- Test paywall (free in simulator)
- Test deletion (moves to Recently Deleted)

## Troubleshooting

### Python Script Issues

**"No images found"**
â†’ Check folder path, ensure it contains .jpg/.png files

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cv2'"**
â†’ Run: `pip install opencv-python pillow numpy imagehash`

**"Permission denied"**
â†’ Run CMD/PowerShell as Administrator

### Swift Package Issues

**"Package.resolved is corrupted"**
â†’ Delete `Package.resolved`, run `swift package resolve`

**"error: failed to fetch"**
â†’ Check internet connection, retry

### Xcode Issues

**"Missing package product 'PhotoSweeperCore'"**
â†’ File â†’ Packages â†’ Reset Package Caches

**"Developer certificate not trusted"**
â†’ Install free profile via Xcode â†’ Settings â†’ Accounts

**"App installation failed"**
â†’ Delete old app from device, clean build (âŒ˜â‡§K), retry

### Runtime Issues

**"This app requires access to Photos"**
â†’ Settings â†’ PhotoSweeper â†’ Photos â†’ Full Access

**"Background task not running"**
â†’ Background tasks are scheduled by iOS (not immediate)
â†’ Simulate: Debug â†’ Simulate Background Fetch

**"Purchase failed"**
â†’ Ensure StoreKit config selected in scheme options

## Testing Checklist

Print this checklist and verify each item:

### Core Package
